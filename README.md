# TrickyStore Helper (by CaptainThrowback, fork maintained by Shoey63)

This helper module rebuilds `target.txt` for **TrickyStore** automatically at device boot (or via Action Button), 
so spoofing targets stay consistent without manual edits.

It now supports:
- All **user-installed apps**
- Core Google components (`Play Store` and `Play Services`)
- Optional **selected system apps** from `system.txt`
